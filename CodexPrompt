PROMPT START

Build a complete Password Strength Checker web application.

Architecture

Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite

Backend: None required unless needed for optional breach-checking

If breach-checking is implemented → use Node.js (Express) or Python (FastAPI)

Styling: TailwindCSS

Provide Dockerfile(s)

Provide docker-compose.yml (even if only the frontend is used, prepare for potential backend)

Clean folder structure

App must be deployable on GCP Cloud Run.

App Purpose

The app must evaluate a password’s strength, provide a numeric score, categorize it, and give actionable feedback.

Scoring Dimensions

The frontend must implement a robust scoring algorithm that evaluates:

1. Length

<8 characters

8–11

12–15

≥16

2. Character Variety

lowercase

uppercase

numbers

symbols

uncommon symbols

3. Pattern Detection

keyboard sequences (e.g., qwerty, asdf, 1234)

repeated characters (aaaaa)

predictable patterns (abc, xyz, 111, 2024)

known weak passwords (password, letmein, etc.)

4. Entropy estimation

Calculate entropy based on character set and length

Derive estimated brute-force time (offline cracking)

5. Dictionary word detection

Detect full words inside the password

Detect reversed words

Detect leetspeak mappings (p@ssw0rd)

6. Optional: Breach Check

If you choose to implement it:

Use the Have I Been Pwned Pwned Passwords API (k-Anonymity)

Never send full password

Implement prefix search (first 5 SHA1 characters)

All evaluation must return:

numeric score: 0–100

category:

Very Weak (0–20)

Weak (21–40)

Medium (41–60)

Strong (61–80)

Very Strong (81–100)

explanations for every deduction

suggestions for improvement

Frontend Requirements

Password input field (masked/unmasked toggle)

Real-time strength evaluation as user types

Display:

Final score (0–100)

Category badge (color-coded)

Entropy (bits)

Estimated cracking time

Triggered warnings (e.g., “Contains dictionary word”)

Improvement suggestions

Optional “Pwned?” result if breach-checking is enabled

Progress bar that visually reflects strength

Dark/light mode toggle

A list of example passwords users can click to auto-fill

Local history stored via localStorage (last 10 evaluations)

Additional UI elements:

Tooltip explaining entropy

Toggle “Check against breach databases” (if backend enabled)

Backend Requirements (Only if breach-checking is enabled)

Implement:

Endpoint: GET /pwned?hashPrefix=xxxxx

Query Have I Been Pwned range API

Return matching suffixes

Frontend performs the last-match check

Never log or store any password

Responses:
{
  "found": true,
  "count": 38422
}


or

{
  "found": false
}


Provide:

Dockerfile

Clean error handling

CORS enabled for frontend origin

DevOps & Deliverables

Provide:

Full frontend code

Optional backend code (if breach-checking is implemented)

Dockerfile(s)

docker-compose.yml

Tailwind config, Vite config, tsconfig

README with:

local setup

Docker instructions

Cloud Run deployment steps

Example passwords + expected evaluations

Unit tests for:

entropy calculation

pattern detection

dictionary detection
